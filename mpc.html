<h3>Books</h3>

Books are always the best way to get started, since they provide a 
holistic presentation of the field. The following books on MPC all teach
 a different aspect, and are all helpful:
<ul>
<li>
David Evans, Vladimir Kolesnikov and Mike Rosulek. <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pragmaticmpc/pragmaticmpc.pdf" target="_blank">A Pragmatic Introduction to Secure Multi-Party Computation</a>,
 NOW Publishers, 2018. This short book contains a friendly introduction 
and comprehensive survey of techniques for achieving efficient secure 
computation. The book does not go into details regarding each technique 
and does not provide proofs. However, it gives a fantastic overview and 
pointers to where you can find all of the details. As such, it is an 
invaluable resource.
</li>
<li>
Ronald Cramer, Ivan Damgård and Jesper Buus Nielsen. <a href="http://users-cs.au.dk/jbn/cdn/" target="_blank">Secure Multiparty Computation and Secret Sharing</a>,
 Cambridge University Press, 2015. This book includes definitions, 
constructions for both the computational and information theoretic 
settings, techniques for efficiency, and more. This is the most 
comprehensive treatment of the basics of MPC, and I recommend reading it
 methodically from the beginning.
</li>
<li>
Carmit Hazay and Yehuda Lindell. <a href="http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~lindell/efficient-protocols.html" target="_blank">Efficient Secure Two-Party Protocols: Techniques and Constructions</a>,
 Springer, 2010. This book focuses specifically on the two-party case 
and efficiency. It includes definitions, general constructions based on 
the garbled circuit technique, and chapters on specific tools like 
oblivious transfer, sigma protocols, and more. The specific techniques 
for general constructions are outdated (with must faster techniques 
available today), but the text is very relevant for study and includes 
basic results like a full proof of the security of Yao's garbled 
circuits construction. 
</li>
<li>
Oded Goldreich. <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/foc-vol2.html" target="_blank">Foundations of Cryptography Vol. 2</a>,
 Cambridge University Press, 2004. Chapter 7 of the book introduces 
two-party and multiparty computation, contains a thorough and 
comprehensive definitional treatment, provides a full and detailed proof
 of the GMW construction, and surveys advanced topics. The book's formal
 and rigorous treatment makes it a must-read for the MPC researcher.
</li>
<li>
Thomas Schneider. <a href="https://www.sites.google.com/site/thomaschneider/publications/engineeringsfebook" target="_blank">Engineering Secure Two-Party Computation Protocols</a>,
 Springer, 2012. This book focuses specifically tools for optimizing 
secure computation in practice, including circuit optimizations, 
frameworks for constructing protocols, and more. The book provides a 
very good overview of different techniques and tools that MPC 
researchers should be familiar with.

Multi-Party Computation </a>,
    </li>
   
<li> Yehuda Lindell. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/300.pdf" target="_blank">Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)</a>,
 Communications of the ACM, January 2021. This is a general and friendly
 introduction to secure multiparty computation - what it is, how it 
works, and what it is used for.
</li>
<li>
Yehuda Lindell. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/046.pdf" target="_blank">How to Simulate It - A Tutorial on the Simulation Proof Technique</a>,
 2016. The simulation paradigm is fundamental to secure computation. 
However, many have difficulties in understanding how to write simulation
 proofs. This tutorial explains this proof technique in great detail.

<li>
Manoj Prabhakaran and Amit Sahai (Eds.). <a href="http://ebooks.iospress.com/volume/secure-multi-party-computation" target="_blank">Secure Multi-Party Computation</a>,
 IOS Press, 2013. This is a compilation of surveys on the topic of 
multiparty computation. It focuses on theoretical aspects and is highly 
useful for those wishing to study the theory of MPC.

</ul>
   
   
   
 <h3>Video Tutorials</h3>

Videos are often a more friendly way of getting started in the field. 
There are many talks that you can find online. Here, I have tried to 
compile series of talks that cover the basics or are tutorials in 
nature.
<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://cyber.biu.ac.il/event/the-1st-biu-winter-school/" target="_blank">The 1st BIU Winter School on Secure Computation and Efficiency</a>, 2011. This series of lectures covers the very basics of secure computation and as such is a useful tool. 
</li>
<li>  <a href="https://cyber.biu.ac.il/event/the-5th-biu-winter-school/" target="_blank">The 5th BIU Winter School on Advances in Practical Multiparty Computation</a>, 2015. This series of lectures begins with tutorials and includes many more advanced techniques. 
</li>
<li> Ran Canetti.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqc9MPlwib9nSuyH4oUIwPsyDiZ4bwuEE" target="_blank">The Universal Composability Framework</a>, 2016. This series of tutorials introduces the universal composability framework in detail.
